Describing any extra work you would consider important to do before this project was turned into a Production application.

1) Performance Optimization
   - Database Indexing:
       Ensure database indexes are set on frequently queried fields (e.g., account IDs). This will improve performance for frequent read and write operations.
   - Load Testing:
       Perform load testing with tools like JMeter to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance under high transaction loads. And Monitor test results with DataDog.

2) Concurrency and Thread Safety
   - Deadlock Prevention:
       Ensure the locking mechanism (synchronized blocks) doesn't introduce deadlocks. Test with high concurrency scenarios and evaluate the system's behavior under load.
   - Optimistic/Pessimistic Locking:
       Depending on the use case, implement optimistic or pessimistic locking to manage concurrent transactions effectively.

3) Documentation
   - API Documentation:
       Ensure that the API is well-documented using Swagger (or OpenAPI). This will help consumers understand how to use the API for money transfers.
   - Deployment Documentation:
       Provide clear instructions on how to build, deploy, and monitor the application. This can be done using Confluence or similar documentation tools.
   - Code Comments:
       Ensure the code is well-commented, especially around complex business logic (like concurrency control).

4) Post-deployment Monitoring
   - Health Checks:
       Implement health checks (e.g., /actuator/health in Spring Boot) to monitor the status of the application in real time.
   - Alerts & Dashboards:
       Configure alert systems and dashboards (In DataDog) to monitor critical metrics like transaction failures, server health, response times, and database load.
